# Minesweeper

### Description
Play a simple minesweeper game. Players can choose from either a GUI verstion (recommended), or a text based interface for the masochists. 

### Result
Currently there are two options for playing this game. The first is invoking main.py in the old-but-works folder. Players have an option for either a GUI version, or a text based version. The second option is invoking main.py in the refactored-text-only folder, which contains improved refactored code. However, only a text interface is available in this directory.

### Future improvements
Transpile python game files into JavaScript, and create a game interface using Javascript, HTML, and CSS
